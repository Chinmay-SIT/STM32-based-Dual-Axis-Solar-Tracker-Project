# STM32-based-Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-Project
## ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and implementation of a dual-axis solar tracker to optimize solar energy collection. Unlike fixed solar panels, the dual-axis system adjusts both the vertical and horizontal angles of the panel to ensure it remains perpendicular to the sunâ€™s rays throughout the day, maximizing energy efficiency. The system employs light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as sensors to detect the sun's position and an STM32 microcontroller to process data and control servo motors for real-time adjustments. The tracker is designed to enhance energy capture, improve overall system efficiency, and demonstrate a cost-effective solution for renewable energy applications. Potential uses include residential solar systems, off-grid energy projects, and educational models for sustainable energy practices.

## INTRODUCTION

Renewable energy is vital in addressing rising energy demands, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change. Among the various renewable sources, solar power is abundant and highly sustainable. However, traditional fixed solar panels are limited in efficiency due to their static orientation.

To overcome this limitation, a dual-axis solar tracking system provides a promising solution. Unlike fixed systems, this tracker dynamically adjusts both horizontal and vertical angles to follow the sun's movement, significantly improving efficiency. This project employs an STM32 microcontroller for enhanced performance, precise control, and energy efficiency.
