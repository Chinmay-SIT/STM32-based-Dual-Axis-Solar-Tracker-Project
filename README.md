# STM32-based-Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-Project
## ABSTRACT

This project presents the design and implementation of a dual-axis solar tracker to optimize solar energy collection. Unlike fixed solar panels, the dual-axis system adjusts both the vertical and horizontal angles of the panel to ensure it remains perpendicular to the sunâ€™s rays throughout the day, maximizing energy efficiency. The system employs light-dependent resistors (LDRs) as sensors to detect the sun's position and an STM32 microcontroller to process data and control servo motors for real-time adjustments. The tracker is designed to enhance energy capture, improve overall system efficiency, and demonstrate a cost-effective solution for renewable energy applications. Potential uses include residential solar systems, off-grid energy projects, and educational models for sustainable energy practices.
